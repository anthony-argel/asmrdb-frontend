# ASMRdb Frontend

## Introduction
[ASMRdb](asmrdb.net) is a site for ASMR enthusiasts. The idea is to have users collect and document information on ASMR YouTubers in a database in order to make it easier to find or discover content. Users have equal power on the website. It is one of the first projects I have written the frontend and backend for. I plan to keep updating it. It is [project 9](https://anthonyargel.com/blog/#/blog/60a19683489181001535cef3) of the [challenge](https://anthonyargel.com/blog/#/blog/6087a2dafedb56001512312d) I set for myself in 2021.

## Implementation
The frontend uses React and Bootstrap 5. It also uses fetch to interact with the API. 
I tried my best to make the site responsive so that phone users can use the site just as well as desktop users.

The backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/anthony-argel/asmrdb-api).

## To-Do
1. Make the frontend look nicer.
2. Add different sorting types for search results.

## Thoughts
I can definitely improve a lot in terms of UX and UI. Send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Anthony_Argel) if you find bugs or security issues. I'd really appreciate it.
